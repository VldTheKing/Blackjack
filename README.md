# Blackjack

**Beat The Dealer**. There are some misconceptions about the objective of the game of blackjack but at the simplest level all you are trying to do is beat the dealer.

**How do you beat the dealer?**

1. By drawing a hand value that is higher than the dealer’s hand value
2. By the dealer drawing a hand value that goes over 21.
3. By drawing a hand value of 21 on your first two cards, when the dealer does not.

**How do you lose to the dealer?** 

1. Your hand value exceeds 21.
2. The dealers hand has a greater value than yours at the end of the round

**How Do You Find a Hand’s Total Value?**
Blackjack is played with a conventional deck of 52 playing cards and suits don’t matter.

1. 2 through 10 count at face value, i.e. a 2 counts as two, a 9 counts as nine.
2. Face cards (J,Q,K) count as 10.
3. Ace can count as a 1 or an 11 depending on which value helps the hand the most.
